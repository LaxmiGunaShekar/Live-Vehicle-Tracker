# Live Vehicle Tracker: A Garbage Truck Alerter

A real-time GPS tracking prototype that sends alerts when a target device is nearby. This project is a proof-of-concept for a system to notify residents when their garbage collection vehicle is approaching.

### Features

* **Real-Time Tracking:** Uses a phone's GPS to transmit a live location.
* **Cloud Communication:** Leverages Google Firestore for instant data synchronization.
* **Distance Calculation:** Accurately calculates the distance between the "truck" and the "resident".
* **Proximity Alerts:** Triggers a console notification when the truck is within a set range.

### How It's Built

The system is split into two main components:

* **The "Truck" (`truck.html`):** A simple webpage that runs on a phone. It grabs the GPS location and sends it to Firestore.
* **The "Alerter" (`tracker.py`):** A Python script that runs on a computer. It listens for location changes in Firestore and calculates the distance.

### How to Get It Running

**1. Set up Firebase**
* Create a new project in the Firebase Console.
* Set up a Firestore Database in **test mode**.
* Go to **Project settings > Service accounts** and **generate a new private key**. Save the downloaded `.json` file.

**2. Configure the Project Files**
* In `truck.html`, replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` variable with your own web app config from Firebase.
* In `tracker.py`, update the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` variable to be the name of your downloaded JSON key.
* Update `LAPTOP_COORDS` with your latitude and longitude.

**3. Install Dependencies**
* Run this command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install google-cloud-firestore geopy
    ```

**4. Run the Application**
* Use `ngrok` to create a secure public URL for your `truck.html` file.
    1.  Start a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
    2.  In a new terminal, run: `ngrok http 8000`
* Open the `https://...` ngrok URL on your phone's browser (e.g., `https://.../truck.html`).
* Run the tracker script on your computer:
    ```bash
    python tracker.py
    ```
