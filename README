# Live Vehicle Tracker

A real-time GPS tracking prototype that sends alerts when a target device is nearby, designed as a proof-of-concept for a garbage truck notification system.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Uses the web Geolocation API to get live GPS coordinates.
- **Cloud Communication**: Leverages Google Firestore for instant data synchronization.
- **Distance Calculation**: Accurately calculates the geodesic distance between two points.
- **Proximity Alerts**: Triggers a console notification when the vehicle is within a set range.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Simulator**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend Tracker**: Python
- **Database**: Google Firestore
- **Geolocation**: Web Geolocation API
- **Tunneling**: ngrok (for development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (v3.6 or higher)
- A Google Account for Firebase

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/LaxmiGunaShekar/Live-Vehicle-Tracker.git](https://github.com/LaxmiGunaShekar/Live-Vehicle-Tracker.git)
    cd Live-Vehicle-Tracker
    ```

2.  Set up your Firebase project
    - Create a project in the Firebase Console and set up a **Firestore Database** in test mode.
    - Go to **Project settings > Service accounts** and **generate a new private key**. Place the downloaded `.json` file in the project root.
    - In your Firebase project settings, find your **web app config** details (`firebaseConfig`).

3.  Configure the project files
    - In `truck.html`, replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` variable with your own.
    - In `tracker.py`, update `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` to be the name of your key file and set your `LAPTOP_COORDS`.

4.  Install dependencies
    ```
    pip install google-cloud-firestore geopy
    ```

## Usage

1.  Start a local server in the project directory
    ```
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

2.  In a new terminal, start ngrok to create a secure tunnel
    ```
    ngrok http 8000
    ```

3.  Open the `https://...` ngrok URL on your mobile phone's browser and add `/truck.html` to the end. Press "Start Transmitting".

4.  Run the tracker script on your computer
    ```
    python tracker.py
    ```

5.  View the real-time distance updates in your terminal.
